In this hands-on exercise, I will create animated data visualisation with gganimate and plotly r packages.

Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames - like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregated data.The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\nBefore diving into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualisation.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves.

While character and factor are both used to store categorical values in R, their purposes differ:\n• character is more flexible for free-form text, such as names or labels that may change over time.\n• factor is more structured and suited for categorical data with a known, limited set of possible values, often used for grouping or plotting.\nGiven this distinction:\n• PA (Planning Area), SZ (Subzone), and Age (Age) are correctly stored as character since they represent a wide range of labels or identifiers that are not necessarily fixed.\n• Sex, however, only contains a small set of known categories (“Males”, “Females”), and is better modeled as a factor for consistency in grouping, analysis, and visualization.\nTo reflect this, the following code converts the Sex column to factor type:\n\nrespop$Sex &lt;- factor(respop$Sex, levels = c(\"Males\", \"Females\"))\n\nThis change ensures that Sex is treated as a proper categorical variable in downstream analysis and plotting.\nThe last two variables, Pop and Time, were initially stored as double-precision numeric values (dbl), which is the default numeric type in R for both whole numbers and decimals. However, since both variables contain only whole numbers, it is more semantically accurate and memory-efficient to convert them to integer (int) type.\n\nPop, which stores resident population counts (rounded to the nearest 10), holds only whole number values. Converting it to integer reinforces its role as a count-based measure.\nTime represents the year of observation and contains a single repeated value (2024). Converting it to integer clarifies its role as a discrete temporal marker.\n\nThe conversion is performed using as.integer() as follows:\n\nrespop$Time &lt;- as.integer(respop$Time)\nrespop$Pop &lt;- as.integer(respop$Pop)\n\nAfter applying the necessary type corrections, the variables and their data types are now summarized below:\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Description of Variables in the `respopagesex` Dataset\n\n\n\nVariable.Name\nDescription\nType\nValue\n\n\n\n\nPA\nPlanning Area\nchar\ne.g. Ang Mo Kio\n\n\nSZ\nSubzone\nchar\ne.g. Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n\n\nAge\nAge (single year of age)\nchar\n0 to 90+\n\n\nSex\nGender\nfct\nMales, Females\n\n\nPop\nResident count (Rounded to nearest 10)\nint\n0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 1180\n\n\nTime\nYear of observation\nint\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespop_description &lt;- data.frame(\n  `Variable Name` = c(\"PA\", \"SZ\", \"Age\", \"Sex\", \"Pop\", \"Time\"),\n  Description = c(\"Planning Area\",\n                  \"Subzone\",\n                  \"Age (single year of age)\",\n                  \"Gender\",\n                  \"Resident count (Rounded to nearest 10)\",\n                  \"Year of observation\"),\n  Type = c(\"char\", \"char\", \"char\", \"fct\", \"int\", \"int\"),\n  Value = c(\"e.g. Ang Mo Kio\",\n            \"e.g. Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\",\n            \"0 to 90+\",\n            \"Males, Females\",\n            \"0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 1180\",\n            \"2024\")\n)\n\nlibrary(kableExtra)\n\nkable(respop_description) %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE) %&gt;%\n  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %&gt;%\n  add_header_above(c(\"Revised Description of Variables in the `respopagesex` Dataset\" = ncol(respop_description)), \n                   bold = TRUE, font_size = 16, color = \"#222222\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRevised Description of Variables in the `respopagesex` Dataset\n\n\n\nVariable.Name\nDescription\nType\nValue\n\n\n\n\nPA\nPlanning Area\nchar\ne.g. Ang Mo Kio\n\n\nSZ\nSubzone\nchar\ne.g. Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\n\n\nAge\nAge (single year of age)\nchar\n0 to 90+\n\n\nSex\nGender\nfct\nMales, Females\n\n\nPop\nResident count (Rounded to nearest 10)\nint\n0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 1180\n\n\nTime\nYear of observation\nint\n2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis can be confirmed via:\n\nglimpse(respop)\n\nRows: 60,424\nColumns: 6\n$ PA   &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo K…\n$ SZ   &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio T…\n$ Age  &lt;chr&gt; \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"3\", \"3\", \"4\", \"4\", \"5\", \"5\", \"6\", …\n$ Sex  &lt;fct&gt; Males, Females, Males, Females, Males, Females, Males, Females, M…\n$ Pop  &lt;int&gt; 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 30, 10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 30, 10, 3…\n$ Time &lt;int&gt; 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024,…\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Creating New Variables\nTo facilitate age-based demographic analysis, a new variable Age_Group was created by binning the Age field into 10-year intervals. This transformation enables grouped aggregation and more interpretable visualizations.\nThe Age variable in the dataset is stored as a character string, containing values such as “0”, “1”, …, “89”, and “90_and_Over”. Using mutate() and case_when() from the dplyr package, each age was categorized into its respective age band, ranging from “0-9” up to “90+”.\n\nrespop &lt;- respop %&gt;%\n  mutate(Age_Group = case_when(\n    Age %in% as.character(0:9) ~ \"0-9\",\n    Age %in% as.character(10:19) ~ \"10-19\",\n    Age %in% as.character(20:29) ~ \"20-29\",\n    Age %in% as.character(30:39) ~ \"30-39\",\n    Age %in% as.character(40:49) ~ \"40-49\",\n    Age %in% as.character(50:59) ~ \"50-59\",\n    Age %in% as.character(60:69) ~ \"60-69\",\n    Age %in% as.character(70:79) ~ \"70-79\",\n    Age %in% as.character(80:89) ~ \"80-89\",\n    Age == \"90_and_Over\" ~ \"90+\"\n  ))\n\nAfter this transformation, the dataset now includes a new column Age_Group, which categorizes each individual into broader age segments, supporting age-grouped aggregation for subsequent visual and statistical analysis.\n\nglimpse (respop)\n\nRows: 60,424\nColumns: 7\n$ PA        &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang Mo Kio\", \"Ang…\n$ SZ        &lt;chr&gt; \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo Kio Town Centre\", \"Ang Mo …\n$ Age       &lt;chr&gt; \"0\", \"0\", \"1\", \"1\", \"2\", \"2\", \"3\", \"3\", \"4\", \"4\", \"5\", \"5\", …\n$ Sex       &lt;fct&gt; Males, Females, Males, Females, Males, Females, Males, Femal…\n$ Pop       &lt;int&gt; 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10, 30, 10, 20, 10, 20, 30, 30, …\n$ Time      &lt;int&gt; 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, 2024, …\n$ Age_Group &lt;chr&gt; \"0-9\", \"0-9\", \"0-9\", \"0-9\", \"0-9\", \"0-9\", \"0-9\", \"0-9\", \"0-9…"

    "text": "4.1 Population by Age Group\nTo understand the age structure of the population, a bar chart was generated to visualize the total resident population by single-year age group (Age_Group). The chart displays a clear distribution across age brackets ranging from infancy (age 0) to the elderly population (90+). This allows for the identification of key demographic cohorts, such as school-age children, working-age adults, and seniors.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(respop, aes(x = Age_Group, y = Pop)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#4682B4\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Singapore Resident Population by Age Groups (2024)\",\n    subtitle = \"Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024\\nby Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 20, r = 40, b = 10, l = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, color = \"grey30\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", colour = \"#f5f5f5\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\nThe visualisations reveal clear patterns in Singapore’s demographic structure in terms of age. The first bar chart shows that the population is concentrated in the working-age groups (30–59), with a notable continuation into the 60–69 group—together forming the largest segments. This suggests a strong labor force base with a significant proportion approaching retirement. Meanwhile, the youngest age groups (0–9, 10–19) and the elderly (70-79, 80–89, and 90+) represent smaller proportions, the former of which points to possibly declining birth rates.\nThis age distribution shows that Singapore may face challenges in the future due to its ageing population. For now, the population steadily increases from young adults to those in their 60s, suggesting a stable group of working-age residents. However, there are fewer young people, which raises concerns about whether there will be enough residents to replace the current workforce over time. Also, as the current labor force will be moving into retirement and fewer younger people will enter the workforce, there may be a rise in the number of dependents compared to workers. To prepare for this, Singapore will need long-term planning in areas like healthcare, eldercare, and policies that encourage higher birth rates or even immigration to support future population needs."

This visual groups males and females side-by-side for each age group bin, offering a straightforward comparison across life stages. In this chart, males are represented in blue and females in pink, ensuring clarity and easy interpretation.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(respop, aes(x = Age_Group, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Males\" = \"#336699\", \"Females\" = \"#CC3366\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = str_wrap(\"Singapore Resident Population by Age Groups and Gender (2024)\", width = 50),\n    subtitle = \"Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024\\nby Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    fill = \"Gender\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, color = \"grey30\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", colour = \"#f5f5f5\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe gender-disaggregated age distribution highlights both demographic symmetry and divergence across life stages. From ages 0 to 49, the number of males and females is relatively balanced, with only minor variations. However, in the 50–59 age group, females begin to noticeably outnumber males. Although this difference persists, the gap narrows slightly in the 60–69 group and 80-89 group before widening again in the 90+ group, where the disparity is most pronounced—females nearly double the male population. Interestingly, the 70–79 cohort shows a temporary reversal, with males slightly outnumbering females, suggesting that survival rates can vary across specific age bands despite overall trends in female longevity. These patterns reflect Singapore’s broader demographic trajectory: gender parity during early and working years, and increasing female dominance in the oldest segments. These insights emphasize the importance of gender-responsive planning in healthcare, eldercare, and retirement policy design."

    "text": "4.3 Population by Planning Area\nThe PA variable, representing Planning Area, was analyzed to understand the spatial distribution of Singapore’s resident population. A horizontal bar chart was plotted, with areas sorted in descending order of population to clearly highlight disparities between more and less densely populated regions. To maintain legibility and avoid overcrowding the chart, only the top 40 planning areas were displayed. This selection provides a view of the most relevant population centers while ensuring the visualization remains clear and interpretable.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nrespop %&gt;%\n  group_by(PA) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Total = sum(Pop)) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Total)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 40) %&gt;%\n  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(PA, Total), y = Total, fill = Total)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  coord_flip() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = comma) +  # format x-axis (now horizontal due to coord_flip)\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"#c6dbef\", high = \"#08306b\") +\n  guides(fill = \"none\") +  # remove legend\n  labs(\n    title = str_wrap(\"Top 40 Planning Areas by Singapore Resident Population (2024)\", width = 60),\n    subtitle = \"Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024\\nby Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, color = \"grey30\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8, color = \"black\", margin = margin(r = 4)),  # reduce overlap\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", colour = \"#f5f5f5\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThis visualisation reveals interesting insights into spatial population concentration in Singapore in 2024. As can be seen from the chart, Tampines, Bedok, and Sengkang emerge as the most populated areas, each exceeding 200,000 residents. In contrast, areas like Western Water Catchment, Sungei Kadut, and Orchard sit at the lower end of the scale. The gradient color fill emphasizes the stark contrast between high- and low-density regions.\nRemarkably, just the top 10 planning areas account for over 50% of the total population of these 40 planning areas, while the top 20 hold more than 75% of the residents. This highlights how urban dwellers are heavily concentrated in a limited number of zones. Furthermore, the top 5 areas collectively house more than 10 times the population of the bottom 5 combined, illustrating stark spatial inequality. These insights on the spatial distribution of Singapore residents support targeted infrastructure investment and equitable resource planning across Singapore’s diverse planning areas."
