Each observation represents a specific demographic segment of Singapore’s resident population, defined by:\n\nPA: Planning Area\nSZ: Subzone\nAge: Single year of age (0–90+)\nSex: Male or Female\n\nBased on the output of the code, there are 4 categorical variables (PA, SZ, Age, and Sex), 1 numerical variable (Pop), and 1 time variable (Time).\n\n\n3.1.3 Checking for Duplicates\nTo ensure data integrity, a check for duplicated records was conducted. Duplicated entries can result in inaccurate analysis due to double counting. The following code block uses group_by_all() and filter(n()\\&gt;1) from the dplyr package to identify fully duplicated rows:\n\nduplicate &lt;- respop %&gt;%\n  group_by_all() %&gt;%\n  filter(n() &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\nduplicate\n\n# A tibble: 0 × 6\n# ℹ 6 variables: PA &lt;chr&gt;, SZ &lt;chr&gt;, Age &lt;chr&gt;, Sex &lt;chr&gt;, Pop &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   Time &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nThe result confirms that no duplicated rows exist.\nTo further verify that each record is unique, the number of distinct combinations across the key demographic variables (PA, SZ, Age, Sex, and Time) was computed:\n\nn_distinct(respop %&gt;% select(PA, SZ, Age, Sex, Time))\n\n[1] 60424\n\n\nThis confirms that all 60,424 rows in the dataset represent unique combinations, with no repetition across the key variables.\n\n\n3.1.4 Checking for Missing Values\nBefore proceeding with the analysis, it is also important to verify whether the dataset contains any missing values, as these may influence the accuracy and integrity of results.\nAn initial check was conducted using is.na() and sum() to detect any missing entries:\n\nwhich(is.na(respop))\n\ninteger(0)\n\nsum(is.na(respop))\n\n[1] 0\n\n\nThis confirms that there are no missing values in the dataset. All six variables (PA, SZ, AG, SEX, Pop, and Time) are complete and require no additional cleaning or row removal. Thus, the dataset is ready for subsequent analysis without further preprocessing."

While character and factor are both used to store categorical values in R, their purposes differ:\n• character is more flexible for free-form text, such as names or labels that may change over time.\n• factor is more structured and suited for categorical data with a known, limited set of possible values, often used for grouping or plotting.\nGiven this distinction:\n• PA (Planning Area), SZ (Subzone), and Age (Age) are correctly stored as character since they represent a wide range of labels or identifiers that are not necessarily fixed.\n• Sex, however, only contains a small set of known categories (“Males”, “Females”), and is better modeled as a factor for consistency in grouping, analysis, and visualization.\nTo reflect this, the following code converts the Sex column to factor type:\n\nrespop$Sex &lt;- factor(respop$Sex, levels = c(\"Males\", \"Females\"))\n\nThis change ensures that Sex is treated as a proper categorical variable in downstream analysis and plotting.\nThe last two variables, Pop and Time, were initially stored as double-precision numeric values (dbl), which is the default numeric type in R for both whole numbers and decimals. However, since both variables contain only whole numbers, it is more semantically accurate and memory-efficient to convert them to integer (int) type.\n\nPop, which stores resident population counts (rounded to the nearest 10), holds only whole number values. Converting it to integer reinforces its role as a count-based measure.\nTime represents the year of observation and contains a single repeated value (2024).

    "text": "4.1 Population by Age Group\nTo understand the age structure of the population, a bar chart was generated to visualize the total resident population by single-year age group (Age_Group). The chart displays a clear distribution across age brackets ranging from infancy (age 0) to the elderly population (90+). This allows for the identification of key demographic cohorts, such as school-age children, working-age adults, and seniors.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(respop, aes(x = Age_Group, y = Pop)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"#4682B4\") +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Singapore Resident Population by Age Groups (2024)\",\n    subtitle = \"Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024\\nby Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.margin = margin(t = 20, r = 40, b = 10, l = 10),\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, color = \"grey30\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", colour = \"#f5f5f5\")\n  ) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)\n\n\n\n\nThe visualisations reveal clear patterns in Singapore’s demographic structure in terms of age. The first bar chart shows that the population is concentrated in the working-age groups (30–59), with a notable continuation into the 60–69 group—together forming the largest segments. This suggests a strong labor force base with a significant proportion approaching retirement. Meanwhile, the youngest age groups (0–9, 10–19) and the elderly (70-79, 80–89, and 90+) represent smaller proportions, the former of which points to possibly declining birth rates.\nThis age distribution shows that Singapore may face challenges in the future due to its ageing population. For now, the population steadily increases from young adults to those in their 60s, suggesting a stable group of working-age residents. However, there are fewer young people, which raises concerns about whether there will be enough residents to replace the current workforce over time. Also, as the current labor force will be moving into retirement and fewer younger people will enter the workforce, there may be a rise in the number of dependents compared to workers. To prepare for this, Singapore will need long-term planning in areas like healthcare, eldercare, and policies that encourage higher birth rates or even immigration to support future population needs."

    "section": "4.2 Population by Gender and Age Group",
    "text": "4.2 Population by Gender and Age Group\nTo gain further insight into population distribution across age brackets, a grouped bar chart taking gender into account is plotted. This visual groups males and females side-by-side for each age group bin, offering a straightforward comparison across life stages. In this chart, males are represented in blue and females in pink, ensuring clarity and easy interpretation.\n\nPlotCode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(respop, aes(x = Age_Group, y = Pop, fill = Sex)) +\n  geom_col(position = \"dodge\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Males\" = \"#336699\", \"Females\" = \"#CC3366\")) +\n  labs(\n    title = str_wrap(\"Singapore Resident Population by Age Groups and Gender (2024)\", width = 50),\n    subtitle = \"Source: Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024\\nby Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)\",\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    fill = \"Gender\"\n  ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5, face = \"bold\", size = 18),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust = 0.5, size = 10, color = \"grey30\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1, size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    axis.text.y = element_text(size = 11, color = \"black\"),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = 12),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"#f5f5f5\", colour = \"#f5f5f5\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\nThe gender-disaggregated age distribution highlights both demographic symmetry and divergence across life stages. From ages 0 to 49, the number of males and females is relatively balanced, with only minor variations. However, in the 50–59 age group, females begin to noticeably outnumber males. Although this difference persists, the gap narrows slightly in the 60–69 group and 80-89 group before widening again in the 90+ group, where the disparity is most pronounced—females nearly double the male population. Interestingly, the 70–79 cohort shows a temporary reversal, with males slightly outnumbering females, suggesting that survival rates can vary across specific age bands despite overall trends in female longevity. These patterns reflect Singapore’s broader demographic trajectory: gender parity during early and working years, and increasing female dominance in the oldest segments. These insights emphasize the importance of gender-responsive planning in healthcare, eldercare, and retirement policy design."

A horizontal bar chart was plotted, with areas sorted in descending order of population to clearly highlight disparities between more and less densely populated regions.

As can be seen from the chart, Tampines, Bedok, and Sengkang emerge as the most populated areas, each exceeding 200,000 residents. In contrast, areas like Western Water Catchment, Sungei Kadut, and Orchard sit at the lower end of the scale. The gradient color fill emphasizes the stark contrast between high- and low-density regions.\nRemarkably, just the top 10 planning areas account for over 50% of the total population of these 40 planning areas, while the top 20 hold more than 75% of the residents. This highlights how urban dwellers are heavily concentrated in a limited number of zones. Furthermore, the top 5 areas collectively house more than 10 times the population of the bottom 5 combined, illustrating stark spatial inequality. These insights on the spatial distribution of Singapore residents support targeted infrastructure investment and equitable resource planning across Singapore’s diverse planning areas."
