# 2.1 Overview

Several **ggplot2 extensions** for creating more elegant and effective statistical graphics. By the end of this exercise, one will be able to:

-   control the placement of annotation on a graph by using functions provided in **ggrepel** package.

-   create professional publication quality figure by using functions provided in **ggthemes** and **hrbrthemes** packages; and

-   plot composite figure by combing ggplot2 graphs by using **patchwork** package.

# 2.2 Getting started

## 2.2.1 Installing and loading the required libraries

In this exercise, besides **tidyverse**, four R packages will be used.

They are:

1.  **ggrepel**: a R package provides geoms for ggplot2 to repel overlapping text labels.

2.  **ggthemes**: a R package provides some extra themes, geoms, and scales for ggplot.

3.  **hrbrthemes**: a R package provides typographu-centric themes and theme components for ggplot2.

4.  **patchwork**: a R package for preparing composite figure created using ggplot2.

Code chunk below will be used to **check** if these packages have been installed and **also load them** onto the working R environment.

```{r}
pacman::p_load(ggrepel, patchwork,
               ggthemes, hrbrthemes,
               tidyverse) #all packages are then installed.
```

## 2.2.2 Importing data

For the purpose of this exercise, a data file called Exam_data will be used. It consists of year end examination grades of a cohort of primary 3 students from a local school. It is in csv file format.

The code chunk below imports exam_data.csv into R environment by using read_csv() function of **readr** package. **readr** is one of the tidyversepackage.

```{r}
library(readr)
exam_data <- read_csv("Exam_data copy.csv")
```

There are a total of seven attributes in the exam_data tibble data frame. Four of them are categorical data type and the other three are in continuous data type.

-   The categorical attributes are ID, CLASS, GENDER and RACE.

-   The continuous attributes are MATHS, ENGLISH and SCIENCE.

# 2.3 Beyond ggplot Annotation: ggrepel

One of the challenge in plotting statistical graph is annotation, especially with large number of data points.

### Used colours to differentiate genders

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS,
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,
              linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_label(aes(label = ID,
                 colour = GENDER), #added colours
             hjust = .5,
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS,
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method=lm,
              linewidth=0.5) +
  geom_label(aes(label = ID),
             hjust = .5,
             vjust = -.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                  ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3")
```

**ggrepel** is an extension of **ggplot2** package which provides `geoms` for **ggplot2** to repel overlapping text as in the examples below.

![](images/ggrepel.jpg)

We simply replace `geom_text()` by [`geom_text_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html) and `geom_label()` with [`geom_label_repel()`](https://ggrepel.slowkow.com/reference/geom_text_repel.html).

## 2.3.1 Working with ggrepel

### Applied colors to differentiate genders.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS,
           y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm,
              size = 0.5) +
  geom_label_repel(aes(label = ID,
                       colour = GENDER), #colour for gender
                   fontface = "bold") +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0,100),
                  ylim = c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores vs Maths scores for P3")
```

# 2.4 Beyond ggplot2 Themes

ggplot2 comes with eight built-in themes. They are:

`theme_gray()`, `theme_bw()`, `theme_classic()`, `theme_dark()`, `theme_light()`, `theme_linedraw()`, `theme_minimal()`, `theme_void()`.

### Applied `theme_light()` and different colors for fill and color.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color = "grey90",
                 fill = "pink") +
  theme_light() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

### Applied theme_dark() and different colors for fill and color.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color = "grey90",
                 fill = "skyblue") +
  theme_dark() +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
```

## 2.4.1 Working with ggtheme package

[**ggthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggthemes/) provides [**ggplot2 themes**](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) that replicate the look of plots by Edward Tuffe, Stephen Few, [Fivethirtyeight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail), ‘Stata’, ‘Excel’, and [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.pinterest.com/wsjgraphics/wsj-graphics/), among others.

In the example below, *The Economist* theme is used.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 20,
                 boundary = 100,
                 color = "grey25",
                 fill = "grey90",
                 linewidth = 0.3) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_stata()
```

It also provides some extra geoms and scales fpr ggplot2. Consult [this vignette](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) to learn more. *\*Link is broken as of Jan 19.*

## 2.4.2 Working with hrbrthemes package

[**hrbrthemes**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=hrbrthemes) package provides a base theme that focuses on typographic elements, including where various labels are placed as well as the fonts that are used.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20,
                 boundary=100,
                 color="grey25",
                 fill="pink") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores") +
  theme_ipsum()
```

### Display English scores.

```{r}
ggplot(data=exam_data,
       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20,
                 boundary=100,
                 color="grey25",
                 fill="grey90") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of English scores") +
  theme_ipsum(axis_text_size = 18,
              base_size = 15,
              grid = "Y") 
```

**\
Tip**

-   `axis_title_size` argument is used to increase the font size of the axis title to 18.

-   `base_size` argument is used to increase the default axis label to 15.

-   `grid` argument is used to remove the x-axis grid lines.

# 2.5 Beyond Single Graph

It is not unusual that multiple graphs are required to tell a compelling visual story. There are several ggplot2 extensions provide functions to compose figure with multiple graphs. In this section, learn how to create composite plot by **combining multiple graphs**. First, let us create three statistical graphics by using the code chunk below.

```{r}
p1 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = MATHS)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of Maths scores")
p1
```

```{r}
p2 <- ggplot(data=exam_data, 
             aes(x = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_histogram(bins=20, 
                 boundary = 100,
                 color="grey25", 
                 fill="grey90") + 
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("Distribution of English scores")
p2
```

Lastly, we will draw a scatterplot for English score vs Maths score by the plot below (Used `theme_economist()`)

```{r}
p100 <- ggplot(data=exam_data,
             aes(x = MATHS,
                 y = ENGLISH)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = lm,
              size = 0.5) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),
                 ylim=c(0,100)) +
  ggtitle("English scores vs Maths scores for P3") +
  theme_economist() +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(size = 10, face = "bold"))
p100
```

## 2.5.1 Creating Composite Graphics: patchwork methods

There are several ggplot2 extension’s functions support the needs to prepare composite figure by combining several graphs such as [`grid.arrange()`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gridExtra/vignettes/arrangeGrob.html) of gridExtra package and [`plot_grid()`](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/reference/plot_grid.html) of [**cowplot**](https://wilkelab.org/cowplot/) package. The extension called [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) is specially designed for combining separate ggplot 2 graphs into a single figure.

Patchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here is the general syntax that combines:

-   Two-column layout using the Plus sign `+`.

-   Parenthesis `()` to create a subplot group.

-   Two-row layout using the Division design `/`

## 2.5.2 Combining two ggplot2 graphs

Figure in the tabset below shows a a composite of two histograms created using patchwork. Code is pretty simple.

## 2.5.3 Combining three ggplot2 graphs

We can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using: - “/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs - “\|” operator to place the plots beside each other - “()” operator to define the sequence of the plotting.

## 2.5.4 Creating a composite figure with tag

In order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.

## 2.5.5 Creating figure with insert

Beside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With [`inset_element()`](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/reference/inset_element.html) of **patchwork**, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.

## 2.5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme

Figure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.
